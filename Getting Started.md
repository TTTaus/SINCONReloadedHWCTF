To get started for the board, you will need to download the Arduino IDE. For some reason, the latest version doesnt play well with it, so you will need to use the legacy edition (v 1.8.19) instead. Arduino IDE can be downloaded from the official site - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Once downloaded and running, connect the e-badge board to the computer using a microUSB cable and follow the following steps:
 - Go to tools
 - Select USB
 - And select the correct USB device

To activate the serial monitor:

 - Go to tools
 - Select Serial Monitor
 - A command-like interface will pop up
 - On the right bottom corner change to the right settings: **Both NL & CR with 9600 baud**
 
 To get started once the setup is done:
 - send `***` in the serial monitor interface. The challenge should officially start.

Do note that **All flags are in lowercase without any brackets**
